### **Project summary**:  
+ In this project, we created an AI program that can enhance the resolution of blurry and low-resolution images. We 1) implemented the current practice as the baseline model, 2) implemented an improvement to the current practice, and 3) evaluated the performance gain of your proposed improvement against the baseline. We utilized tensorflow in python as improved model.For baseline model we used `doParallel`,`gbm` and `EBImage` library in R to do super-resolution of the images. We calculated the MSE and PSNR for evaluation purpose. Our model is better than the nerest-neighbor method and bilinear interpolation. Additionally, it is better than bicubic interpolation as well.
+ The MSE and PSNR for baseline model are *0.0028* and *27.4187* respectively, and the MSE and PSNR for improved model are *0.0022* (because R and Python use different scale for RGB, the best way to compare two models is to use PSNR) and *27.8961* respectively, which is obviously better than the baseline models.

### For grading about `srgan` model
When use [SRGAN.ipynb](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spring2019-Proj3-grp12/blob/master/doc/SRGAN.ipynb) to run the `srgan` model, just set corresponding `train set path` and `test set path`. Set `validation=Fasle` to use the all the train data to train. Set `n_epoch_init=10` to initialize the model. This might cost about 30 mins locally for each epoch. Set `n_epoch=20` (no less than 10) to train the total `srgan` model. This might cost about 50 mins locally for each epoch.

### Contribution Statement
